# W.js – Version 2.4.1

> "A Welterweight Backbone.js & Miscellaneous Utility Pack."

Client and server side JavaScript library produced & used by TheWorkers.net, a creative studio based in East London.

### From Version 1 to Version 2 Notes.

For any sites/apps using version 1 please use commit ef7b74cdd67500fd857a18c7c244de378fc6cedb and before.

__Version 2__ removes much functionailty from version 1, as well as docs and examples in favour of a full test suite. Untested & rough functionality can be found in the "dev" branch. All object in Version 2 have been changed to use a `W.Object` pattern (inspired by, [but not implemented](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/pull/276) in, [backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/)).
